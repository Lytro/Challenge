Movie Marathon Challenge
------------------------

Allow a user to register for your app. Once they are registered, they can connect their Netflix account. With the Netflix API get a list of recommended titles. You should be able to build a playlist for a movie marathon based on the amount of time for the users marathon party, and the genre of the party. You'll want to fill up the playlist with the maximum amount of movies for the allotted time for the party. Of course you'd want to watch the best movie last to close out the show, and movies that are in a series should play in the order they were intended. 

Once the party is planned the user should be able to share and Invite a select set of Friends on Facebook.
